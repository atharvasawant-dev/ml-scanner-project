PRAMAAN is an intelligent nutrition intelligence platform designed to decode packaged foods for health-conscious consumers. By scanning barcodes or nutrition fact labels, PRAMAAN analyzes nutrients, detects risky ingredients and additives, generates explainable health scores, provides healthier product alternatives, deterministically verifies front-of-pack regulatory health claims against official FSSAI standards, and tracks personal food consumption.

## 1. Project Purpose & Core Invariant

### Purpose
Consumers frequently purchase packaged foods without understanding misleading claims, hidden sugars, harmful additives, or excess sodium. PRAMAAN provides instant, scientific, transparent nutritional clarity.

### Core Domain Invariant: Scan ≠ Eat
**Scanning or analyzing a food product must never automatically log consumption.**
- **Scanning (`POST /scan` or barcode lookup)** queries product intelligence and logs an entry strictly to `scan_history`.
- **Consumption (`POST /food-log`)** is only recorded when the user explicitly triggers an intake action (e.g. tapping `+ Log to Daily Diary` on mobile).

## 3. Component Details

### A. Core Backend & Database
- **Framework:** FastAPI with Uvicorn.
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy declarative models with automated database schema migration (`init_db.py`).
- **Database Support:** Dual compatibility for SQLite (local development and portable tests) and PostgreSQL (production).
- **Domain Tables:**
  - `users`: User profiles, credentials, age, weight, height, daily calorie budgets, and diet types.
  - `products`: Barcode, product name, brand, nutriscore, ingredients, additives.
  - `nutrition`: Macro- and micronutrients per 100g (calories, fat, sugar, salt, protein, fiber, carbs).
  - `scan_history`: Immutable log of scanned products per user.
  - `daily_food_log`: Explicit food intake entries per user.
  - `user_diet_profile`: Macro limit thresholds.

### B. Health Scoring & Ingredient Analysis
- **Standardized Salt Threshold:** Standardized across scoring engines and decision explainers at `1.5g / 100g`.
- **Diet-Aware Scoring:** Adapts penalties based on user profile (e.g., low-sodium diet triples salt penalties).
- **Ingredient & Additive Intelligence:** Token boundary matching (`\b`) and longest-match-first sorting prevents substring false positives (e.g., "msg" inside "message") and eliminates duplicate flag reporting.

### C. Machine Learning Pipeline
- **NutriScore Classification:** Trained ensemble/scikit-learn models (`ensemble_model.pkl`, `model.pkl`) predict missing NutriScore grades (A through E).
- **Validation Metrics:** Evaluated on held-out test data with **82.69% held-out test accuracy** (documented baseline test metric; not a live production guarantee).
- **Inference Determinism:** Explicit feature validation and class probability distributions; missing/corrupted models raise explicit `ModelArtifactError` rather than silently failing to heuristic fallbacks.

### D. OpenFoodFacts Integration
- Resilient multi-tier product lookup with automatic failover.
- Network error handling, timeouts, and HTTP status handling (404/500).
- Automatic nutrient normalization: converts sodium to salt (`salt = sodium * 2.5`) and energy kJ to kcal (`kcal = kJ / 4.184`).

### E. Healthier Product Recommendations
- Automatic food category inference (`infer_food_category`) for Indian and global packaged food categories.
- Deterministic alternative ranking calculates percentage nutritional advantages (e.g. `-45% sugar`, `+20% fiber`).

### F. Mobile Client (Expo SDK 54)
- **Engine:** React Native 0.81.5 with React 19.1.0 on Expo SDK 54 (`~54.0.33`).
- **Camera Scanning:** Native camera barcode scanning powered by `expo-camera` (`~17.0.10`) with zero legacy `expo-barcode-scanner` dependencies.
- **Dynamic LAN IP Routing:** Automatic extraction of the developer machine's LAN host from Expo debug manifests (`Constants.expoConfig.hostUri`, etc.), allowing physical iPhones and Android devices to seamlessly connect to the local backend without hardcoding `localhost`.
- **OCR Label Scanning:** Full workflow using `expo-image-picker` with review/edit capabilities before logging or analyzing.

### G. Security Layer
- **Authentication:** Salted bcrypt password hashing (`passlib[argon2]`) and standard JWT Bearer token generation.
- **CORS Protection:** Wildcard `*` disabled; strict origin validation supporting localhost, Expo local development ports, and regex-matched private LAN subnets (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16-31.x.x`).
- **Endpoint Protection:** All personal, scanning, reporting, comparison, and analysis routes require authenticated JWT Bearer headers.

### H. Health Claim Verification Engine (`services/claim_verification.py`)
- **Deterministic FSSAI Compliance:** Verifies front-of-pack and marketing claims against declared product nutrition, ingredients, and official statutory criteria from the *Food Safety and Standards (Advertising and Claims) Regulations, 2018* (Schedule I, Schedule II, and Regulation 4(5)).
- **Versioned Regulatory Rules:** Rules are defined as declarative data configurations (`ClaimRule`, `RegulatorySource`) in `REGULATORY_RULES`, completely separating regulatory criteria and source citations from verification execution logic.
- **Supported Regulatory Claims:**
  1. **No Added Sugar:** Verified against ingredient declaration for absence of mono/disaccharides, syrups, honey, or fruit juice concentrates (FSSAI Reg 4(5) & Schedule I).
  2. **Sugar Free:** Total sugars $\le 0.5\text{ g} / 100\text{g}$ (solids) or $100\text{ml}$ (liquids) (FSSAI Schedule I).
  3. **Low Sodium:** Sodium $\le 0.12\text{ g} / 100\text{g}$ ($\le 120\text{ mg}$), or equivalent salt $\le 0.3\text{ g} / 100\text{g}$ (FSSAI Schedule I).
  4. **High Protein:** Protein $\ge 20\%$ of adult 54g RDA ($\ge 10.8\text{ g} / 100\text{g}$) (FSSAI Schedule I).
  5. **High Fibre:** Dietary fibre $\ge 6.0\text{ g} / 100\text{g}$ (FSSAI Schedule I).
  6. **Low Fat:** Total fat $\le 3.0\text{ g} / 100\text{g}$ for solid foods (FSSAI Schedule I).
  7. **Zero Trans Fat:** Trans fatty acids $< 0.2\text{ g} / 100\text{g}$ and saturated fat $\le 1.5\text{ g} / 100\text{g}$ if declared (FSSAI Schedule I).
- **Verification Statuses:**
  - `SUPPORTED`: Available product data satisfies verified rule criteria.
  - `NOT_SUPPORTED`: Available product data conflicts with rule criteria.
  - `NEEDS_REVIEW`: Unrecognized claim or requires specialized manual inspection.
  - `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`: Required nutrient or ingredient declaration is missing (never guessed).
- **Core Domain Distinctions:**
  - **Health Score:** Continuous numerical algorithm (0-100) evaluating global nutritional profile.
  - **Health Claim Verification:** Deterministic statutory check evaluating whether marketing claims comply with FSSAI regulations.
  - **Ingredient Analysis:** Qualitative token scanning identifying additives, allergens, and preservatives.
- **Future Rule Maintenance:** Regulatory rule metadata is stored in `REGULATORY_RULES` with version and effective dates; new FSSAI notifications can be updated without modifying verification engine logic.
- **Statutory Disclaimer:** *"The system provides a rule-based assessment of product claims based on available product data and referenced regulatory criteria. It is not a legal certification."*

# From repository root:
.\foodscanner-ai\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest foodscanner-ai/tests -v

# From foodscanner-ai directory:
cd foodscanner-ai
python -m pytest tests -v
```
**Results:** **57 passed**, 0 failed, 0 errors.

### Mobile Test Suite (Node.js Native Test Runner)
```bash
# From foodscanner-mobile directory:
cd foodscanner-mobile
npm test
# or:
node --test tests/
```
**Results:** **5 passed**, 0 failed across 2 suites.

## 8. Current Limitations (Phase 2 State)
1. **Health Claim Verification Scope:** Phase 2 Batch 5 supports 7 core FSSAI claims ("No Added Sugar", "Sugar Free", "Low Sodium", "High Protein", "High Fibre", "Low Fat", "Zero Trans Fat"). Expansion to vitamin/mineral micronutrient claims and Front-of-Pack mobile verification badges are scheduled for subsequent iterations.
2. **OCR 2.0:** OCR parses nutrition tables; multi-label packaging bounding boxes and FSSAI license OCR are not yet supported (scheduled for subsequent Phase 2 batches).
3. **Mobile Compare UI:** While `/compare` and recommendation engines exist in the backend, the mobile client does not yet include a dedicated comparison screen (scheduled for subsequent Phase 2 batches).
4. **Physical Device Validation:** The mobile app has been validated via Expo dev server, LAN configuration, and automated unit tests. Physical iPhone field testing requires an in-person device on the local network.
